# TODO: Claw Empire Core

**Last audited:** 2026-05-24  
**Status:** Stable v2.0.4, clean working tree, all tests gated in CI pipeline  
**Path:** claw-empire

## 🚧 BOTTLENECKS — Need from Stockton

- [ ] **Docker `.env.docker.private` setup** — File referenced in `docker-compose.yml:12` but not tracked (git-ignored). Needs template or documented generation path for container deployments.
- [ ] **Stale `.env.docker` path** — Docker compose references `.env.docker` (line 12) but only `.env` + `.env.example` exist in repo. Clarify Docker-vs-local env separation.

## 👤 Stockton's tasks

- [ ] Verify Docker deployment pipeline (Dockerfile builds cleanly, compose runs on target infra)
- [ ] Document `.env.docker` / `.env.docker.private` generation for containerized deployments
- [ ] Audit OpenCode Go and Bailian Coding Plan presets post-v2.0.4 integration (Settings > API presets)
- [ ] Test Kimi Code end-to-end flow (provider selection → task execution → skill routing)

## 🤖 Claude's tasks

- [ ] **Add `.env.docker` template** — Create `.env.docker.example` mirroring `.env.example` structure for container users — **S**
- [ ] **Resolve Docker env references** — Either create tracked `.env.docker` files or update compose to reference only `.env` — **S**
- [ ] **Grep full codebase for TODO/FIXME** — Ripgrep timed out on full project (>20s); run locally to capture any sprint backlog — **M**
- [ ] **Verify E2E test isolation** — Post-v2.0.4 `.tmp/e2e-runtime` reset logic; confirm Playwright no longer reuses port 8810 by default — **M**
- [ ] **Cross-check migration script `auto-apply-v1.0.5.mjs`** — Hooked in all `pre*` scripts; verify it's idempotent for repeated dev runs — **M**

## ✅ Recently shipped

- v2.0.4 (2026-03-12): Docker first-class support, stale agent recovery, Kimi Code end-to-end, official API presets (OpenCode Go, Bailian), hydrated pack API assignment
- E2E runtime safety: reset `.tmp/e2e-runtime` before + after Playwright, opt-in server reuse via `PW_REUSE_EXISTING_SERVER=1`
- Emoji picker translation regression test (decision-request multiline/Korean parsing) — `src/components/chat/decision-request.test.ts:5-20`

## ⚠️ Memory mismatch detected

None. Memory from 2026-05-20 accurately reflects current state:
- v2.0.4 version stamp in `package.json:3` ✓
- TypeScript/Vite/SQLite/Docker stack confirmed ✓
- SQLite DB exists + recent (`claw-empire.sqlite`, last updated 2026-04-16 3:45 PM) ✓
- Clean main branch, dev branch tracking origin/dev with PR #66 merge ancestry ✓
- CI pipeline gates: format, lint, OpenAPI contract, type check, build, e2e tests ✓

## 🔍 Gap analysis — added by Claude 2026-06-08

- [ ] **Fix the stuck push (wrong GitHub owner on `origin`)** — Right now `main` is 9 commits ahead but can't be pushed because the `origin` remote points at a GitHub account that isn't the one logged in here (`origin` = `GreenSheep01201/claw-empire`, but the saved login is `stocktonsassistant-web`). Good news: a second remote called `aettam` (`Aettam/claw-empire.git`) already exists. Decide which GitHub repo is the real home, then either get added as a collaborator on it or repoint `origin` to a repo you own — and push so those 9 commits stop living only on this PC. (This is the #1 thing keeping your work from being backed up online.)
- [ ] **Actually stand up the public deploy — or decide to stay local** — The `deploy/` folder has finished server setup files (systemd + nginx) for putting this online, but it's never been deployed anywhere public. Either follow those configs to launch it on a server, or make a clear note that it's intentionally local-only, so this half-built deploy path stops being a loose end.
- [ ] **Confirm the database is being backed up somewhere** — The live data lives in one SQLite file (`claw-empire.sqlite`) that is correctly NOT committed to git. That's right for git, but it also means there is no copy anywhere if this PC dies. Set up a simple scheduled copy of that file to Dropbox/another drive so a disk failure doesn't wipe the whole pretend-company's state.

## Claude triage - 2026-06-09 (agent fleet scan)
_A fleet of Claude agents read this list on 2026-06-09 and sorted what is left._

**Claude can do these anytime - just ask:**
- [medium impact / small effort] Docker `.env.docker.private` setup â€” file referenced in docker-compose.yml:12 but not tracked; needs template or documented generation path
- [medium impact / small effort] Stale `.env.docker` path â€” compose references .env.docker but only .env + .env.example exist; clarify Docker-vs-local env separation
- [low impact / small effort] Document `.env.docker` / `.env.docker.private` generation for containerized deployments
- [medium impact / small effort] Add `.env.docker` template â€” create `.env.docker.example` mirroring `.env.example` structure for container users
- [medium impact / small effort] Resolve Docker env references â€” either create tracked `.env.docker` files or update compose to reference only `.env`

- [medium impact / medium effort] Cross-check migration script `auto-apply-v1.0.5.mjs` â€” hooked in all `pre*` scripts; verify it's idempotent for repeated dev runs
- [high impact / small effort] Fix the stuck push (wrong GitHub owner on `origin`) â€” repoint origin or push to the existing `aettam` remote so 9 local-only commits get backed up online
- [high impact / small effort] Confirm the database is being backed up somewhere â€” set up a scheduled copy of `claw-empire.sqlite` to Dropbox/another drive

**Waiting on you (signups, keys, payments, decisions):**
- Verify Docker deployment pipeline (Dockerfile builds cleanly, compose runs on target infra)
- Audit OpenCode Go and Bailian Coding Plan presets post-v2.0.4 integration (Settings > API presets)
- Test Kimi Code end-to-end flow (provider selection â†’ task execution â†’ skill routing)
- Actually stand up the public deploy â€” or decide to stay local (deploy/ has finished systemd + nginx configs, never deployed)
